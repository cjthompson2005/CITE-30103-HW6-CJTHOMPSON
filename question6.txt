Question 6: Identifier naming errors and rules violated

Original lines:
int 1value = 10;
float avg-rate = 12.5;
char Class = 'A';

Corrections and explanation:
1) int 1value = 10;
   - Invalid: identifier cannot begin with a digit.
   - Correct: int value1 = 10;

2) float avg-rate = 12.5;
   - Invalid: '-' is the subtraction operator; identifiers cannot contain '-'.
   - Correct: float avg_rate = 12.5;

3) char Class = 'A';
   - Valid in C, but 'Class' may be confusing; identifiers are case-sensitive. There's no rule violation unless reserved keyword used.
   - It's recommended to avoid names that look like keywords; 'class' is a C++ keyword but not C, but for clarity use: char classLetter = 'A';
